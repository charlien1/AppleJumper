**Apple Jumper**    
-----------------------
The game Apple Jumper is the finalized version of my previous games. It is a 2D platformer with multiple levels where you need to collect all the apples on the screen in order to progress to the next level. You control your character with WAD and Space to move and jump. The game saves your progress during each level. You will be able to go back to the main menu or relaunch the game and load back to the level you were on previously.
